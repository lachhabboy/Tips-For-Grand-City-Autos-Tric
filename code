		"description": "In need of some quick money that's not generated by properties? Well, you'll be glad to know that there are many ways to earn money quickly that don't require too many requirements at all. So here's a quick breakdown of all of the best money-making methods that will help you reach your goal of owning your very own properties.
                    Arguably, one of the easiest ways to make money early on in the game is to run over parking meters, as they are known to drop money upon running them over. While it's not necessarily a lot, it will begin to add up quickly as the process of running over the meters, and the rate at which they respawn is very quick. Although running any parking meter over will work, we found the best location to perform this money-making method is on the main road beneath the bridge that heads over to Prawn Island, as there are quite a few located along this street.
                    The following method is also relatively simple, and while it won't earn you as much as the parking meters, it's a good option if you're looking to go AFK. To do this method, find a Coach and activate its missions. From there, park the Coach next to a bus stop and watch as pedestrians begin boarding the bus. Each pedestrian that boards will earn you $5.00. As we said, it's not a lot of money, but if you leave your game running while you're AFK, you'll earn a pretty penny.
                    So now that you've earned enough money from these early-game activities, you'll want to make sure that your first major property purchase is the Malibu Club, which is unlocked after the Shakedown mission. Although the property will set you back a whopping $120,000, you'll receive $10,000 a day in revenue. This means that your investment will take little to no time at all to return a positive.

		"description": "Throughout the game, you'll find several hidden Easter Eggs and Secrets that have been scattered throughout the map. While some are a little easier to come by, some are hidden so well that the chances of you ever finding them without a guide will be very slim -- yes, we're talking about the infamous literal Easter Egg.
                    For a complete guide to finding all known Easter Eggs in Vice City, check out our detailed guide here.
                    Want to snag some free weapons and body armor? Consider collecting the Hidden Packages that have been scattered all across the map. Should you happen to collect specific amounts of these packages, you'll unlock free Body Armor, Flame-Throwers, Miniguns, a Rhino Tank, and even a Hunter Helicopter.
                    That's not all, as there are also plenty of other Collectibles such as Rampages and Stunt Jumps that provide a number of helpful rewards such as money. So for even more information, be sure to check out our complete guide to all Collectibles in GTA Vice City.
                    Unlike other GTA games in the series, there are no consequences for visiting the second island before the bridges finally open up -- these bridges are initially blocked following a hurricane warning at the beginning of the game. Visiting the second island can be done in two ways before it's actually unlocked.
                    The first method will see you using cheats such as Cars Can Fly on Water, but we get that not everyone wants to use cheats within their game.
                    Our second method will take a little bit of time, as you'll first need to head up to the bridge that crosses over to Prawn Island. From here, wait by the edge of the bridge and look for a boat that will eventually pass underneath. As the boat passes beneath the bridge, you'll want to jump down onto the boat. If you manage to time your jump successfully, you'll now have full access that will allow you to travel to the other side of the island.",

		"description": "Side Missions are a fantastic way to earn helpful rewards that will benefit you throughout your time in Vice City. While it's worthwhile completing all Side Missions, you will definitely want to complete the Police Car Vigilante Missions first as getting through to level 12 will earn you a nice boost to your body armor protection - an increase to 150 damage protection to be exact.
                    In addition to the Vigilante Missions, you'll also receive an increase to 150 Health should you complete all ten levels of the Pizza Boy Missions.
                    Hidden throughout Vice City, you'll find weapons that spawn for free around the map. While it'll always be more efficient to visit a gun store, saving some cash -- especially during your early game experience -- will be a lifesaver. So whether it's picking up the Uzi from behind the Pay N Spray in Ocean Beach or grabbing the Knife by the Pizza store that's not too far from the Malibu Club, here's a complete list of all weapons and their spawn locations in-game.",
